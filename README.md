### The museum of modern art<br>
##### Museum of Modern Art (aka MoMa) houses one of the world’s finest collections of modern art. In addition to its **renowned permanent collection**, MoMa presents special exhibitions (that are often among the hottest tickets in town), and **special events**. With six floors of galleries showcasing thousands of artworks, it can be challenging to navigate the large museum and find key works. But fear not: we’ve compiled a list of some of MoMa’s most significant artworks.
